# Test-Driven Development (TDD)
The Place object business logic was built using TDD. Below are sample tests written conceptually (you can implement using any JS testing framework like Jest if desired):

# Place Object Tests
js
Copy
Edit
// Pseudo-tests (can be adapted to real test framework)
function testPlaceObjectCreation() {
  const place = new Place("Paris", ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre"], "Spring", "Romantic trip");

  console.assert(place.location === "Paris", "Location should be 'Paris'");
  console.assert(place.landmarks.includes("Louvre"), "Should include 'Louvre'");
  console.assert(place.timeOfYear === "Spring", "Time of year should be 'Spring'");
  console.assert(place.notes === "Romantic trip", "Notes should match input");
  console.assert(
    place.getSummary() === "Paris in Spring: Romantic trip",
    "getSummary() should return the correct string"
  );
}

testPlaceObjectCreation();

# Tests
Include example tests (manual or automated) or describe how testing was done.

js
Copy
Edit
// Sample pseudo-test
const place = new Place("Tokyo", ["Shibuya"], "Spring", "Cherry blossom season");
console.assert(place.location === "Tokyo", "Location should be Tokyo");
